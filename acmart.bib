abstract = {In this paper we introduce Chisel, a new hardware construction language that supports advanced hardware design using highly parameterized generators and layered domain-specific hardware languages. By embedding Chisel in the Scala programming language, we raise the level of hardware design abstraction by providing concepts including object orientation, functional programming, parameterized types, and type inference. Chisel can generate a high-speed C++-based cycle-accurate software simulator, or low-level Verilog designed to map to either FPGAs or to a standard ASIC flow for synthesis. This paper presents Chisel, its embedding in Scala, hardware examples, and results for C++ simulation, Verilog emulation and ASIC synthesis.},

abstract = {Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a programming technique to implement software product lines based on composition mechanisms called refinements. A software product line is a set of software systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment. The literature reports various software metrics for software product lines developed using object-oriented and aspect-oriented programming. However, after a literature review, we observed that we lack the definition of FOP-specific metrics. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a set of eight novel metrics for feature-oriented programming. These metrics were derived both from our experience in FOP and from existing software metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed metrics by applying them to a software product line.},

abstract = {Timed automata are state-machine-like structures used to model real-time systems. Since their invention in the early 1990s, a number of often subtly differing variants have appeared in the literature; one of this article’s key contributions is defining, highlighting, and reconciling these differences. The article achieves this by defining a baseline theory of timed automata, characterizing each variant both syntactically and semantically, and giving, when possible, syntactic and semantic conversion to and from the baseline version. This article also surveys various extensions to the basic timed-automaton framework.},

For the how we compare a variety of approaches and techniques based on program transformation and generation. On the one hand, we present the evolution of open-ended languages from metalevel programming to aspect-oriented programming. On the other hand, we introduce domain-specific languages as a way to bridge the gap between conceptual models and programming languages.",

abstract = {We present a broad extension of the conventional formalism of state machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification and design of complex discrete-event systems, such as multi-computer real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units. Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively, with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact and expressive—small diagrams can express complex behavior—as well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification. We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification of a particularly complex system.}
